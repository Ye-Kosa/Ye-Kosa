## HELLO Welcome To my Introduction!
### Disclaimer!!!
I Am a MINOR. Please Do not INteract with me With NSFW/Innapropriate Topics, I Am not comfortable With That.
I Realize that I have A Typing Quirk, Please do not Harass me For it. I am Sorry if it Is Hard to Read.

# DO NOT INTERACT IF YOU ARE:
**PRO-RUSSIAN, PRO-ISRAEL, HOMOPHOBIC, TRANSPHOBIC, do PROSHIP/CONSHIP, HARASS PEOPLE FOR THEIR BOUNDARIES.** 
I realize the last one might be a bit hypocritical because of an incident, but I want to say that I deeply apologize to ones I've hurt without realizing their boundaries come from a genuine place. I participated in a harassment of you out of the need to be relatable, I believe I can change, I am sorry again.
